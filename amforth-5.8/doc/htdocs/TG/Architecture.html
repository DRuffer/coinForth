<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>amforth is a 16 bit Forth implementing the indirect threading
model. The flash memory contains the whole dictionary. A few EEPROM
cells are used to hold initial values and the dictionary pointers.
The RAM contains buffers, variables and the stacks.</p>
<p>The compiler is a classic compiler without any optimization
support.</p>
<p>amforth uses all of the CPU registers to hold vital data: The
data stack pointer, the instruction pointer, the user pointer, and
the Top-Of-Stack cell. The hardware stack is used as the return
stack. Some registers are used for temporary data in primitives.</p>

<h2>CPU &#8211; Forth VM Mapping<a class="headerlink" href="#cpu-forth-vm-mapping" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Forth VM has a few registers that need to be mapped to the

<p>In addition the register pair R0:R1 is used internally e.g. to
hold the the result of multiply operations. The register pair R2:R3
is used as the zero value in many words. These registers must never
be changed.</p>
<p>The registers from R10 to R13 are currently unused, but may be
used for the VM extended registers X and Y sometimes. The
registers R14 to R21 are used as temporary registers and can be used
freely within one module as temp0 to temp7.</p>

<p>For the indirect threading model an inner interpreter is
needed. The inner interpreter does the interrupt handling too.
It repeatedly reads the cell, the <strong class="command">IP</strong> points to, takes this number
as the address for the next code segment and jumps to that code.
It is expected that this code segment does a jump back to the
inner interpreter (NEXT). The <strong class="command">IP</strong> is incremented by 1 just before
the jumps are done to get the next cell.</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="next">
<h4>NEXT<a class="headerlink" href="#next" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The NEXT routine is the core of the inner interpreter. It does the
mapping between the execution tokens and the corresponding machine
code. It consists of 4 steps which are executed for every forth word.</p>
<p>The first step is to check whether an interrupt needs to
be handled. It is done by looking at the <strong class="command">T</strong>
flag in the machine status register. If it is set, the code jumps
to the interrupt handling part.</p>
<p>The next step is to read the cell the <strong class="command">IP</strong> points to and
stores this value in the W register. For a COLON word
W contains the address of the code field.</p>
<p>The 3rd step is to increase the <strong class="command">IP</strong> register by 1.</p>
<p>The 4th step is the EXECUTE step.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="execute">
<h4>EXECUTE<a class="headerlink" href="#execute" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>This operation is the JUMP.  It reads the content of the cell the
<strong class="command">W</strong> register points to. The result is stored in the scratch pad
register <strong class="command">X</strong>. The data in <strong class="command">X</strong> is the address of the machine code to be
executed in the last step. This step is used by the forth command
<strong class="command">EXECUTE</strong> too. The forth command does not get the address
of the next destination from the current <strong class="command">IP</strong> but from the data stack.</p>
<p>This last step finally jumps to the machine code pointed to
by the <strong class="command">X</strong> scratch pad register.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="do-colon">
<h4>DO COLON<a class="headerlink" href="#do-colon" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>DO COLON (aka NEST) is the subroutine call. It pushes the
<strong class="command">IP</strong> onto the return stack. It then increments <strong class="command">W</strong>
by one flash cell, so that it points to the body of the (colon) word,
and sets <strong class="command">IP</strong> to that value. Then it continues with
<strong class="command">NEXT</strong>, which begins executing the words in the body
of the (parent) colon word. Note that <strong class="command">W</strong> points to
the execution token of the current word, so W+1 points to the

<h2>Text Interpreter<a class="headerlink" href="#text-interpreter" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The interpreter is a line based command interpreter. It based upon <strong class="command">REFILL</strong>
to acquire the next line of characters, located at a position <strong class="command">SOURCE</strong> points to.
While processing the line, the pointer <strong class="command">&gt;IN</strong> is adjusted accordingly. Both
words <strong class="command">REFILL</strong> and <strong class="command">SOURCE</strong> are USER based deferred words which
allows to use any input source on a thread specific level. The interpreter itself
does not use any static buffers or variables (<strong class="command">&gt;IN</strong> is a USER variable as well).</p>
<p>A given string is handled by <strong class="command">INTERPRET</strong> which splits it
into whitespace delimited words. Every word is processed using a list of
recognizers. Processing ends either when the string end is reached or an exception occurs.</p>
<div class="section" id="source-and-refill">
<h3>SOURCE and REFILL<a class="headerlink" href="#source-and-refill" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p><strong class="command">SOURCE</strong> provides an addr/len string pair that does not change

buffer, <strong class="command">SOURCE</strong> points to when finished.</p>
<p>There is one default input source: The terminal input buffer. This buffer gets filled with
<strong class="command">REFILL-TIB</strong> that reads from the serial input buffers (<strong class="command">KEY</strong>).

<p>Recognizer are a part of the text (command) interpreter.
They are responsible for analyzing a single word. The
result consists of two elements: The actual data (if any)
and an object like identifier connected with certain methods.</p>

</span>
<p>The Forth text interpreter reads from the input source
and splits it into whitespace delimited words. Each word
is fed into a list of actions which parse it. If the
parsing is successful (e.g. it is a number or a word from
the dictionary) the recognizer leaves the data and
an method table to deal with it. Depending on the
interpreter state one of the methods is executed to
finally process the data. The first method is called
in interpreter state. It is usually a noop, since
the recognizer has done all the work already.</p>
<p>The 2nd method is responsible to perform the compile
time semantics. That usually means to write it into
the dictioanary or to execute immediate words.</p>
<p>The third method is used by :command`postpone` to compile the
compilation semantics. It honors the immediate flags as well.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Do</span> <span class="pre">Recognizer</span></tt> is an iteration over the recognizer
stack until the first parsing methods returns something
different than <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r:fail</span></tt>. If the recognizer stack is
exhausted without a match, the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r:fail</span></tt> return value
is generated. The string location that is passed to the
parse actions is preserved and is restored for every iteration
cycle.</p>

<p>A recognizer consists of a few words that work together.
To ease maintenance, a naming convention is used: The
recognizer itself is named with the prefix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">rec:</span></tt>. The
method table name gets the prefix <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">r:</span></tt> followed by
the same name as the recognizer.</p>

<p>The word <strong class="command">rec:foo</strong> is the actual recognizer. It analyzes the
string it gets. There are two results possible: Either the word
is recognized and the address of the method table is returned
or a failure information is generated which is actually a predefined
method table named <strong class="command">r:fail</strong>.</p>
<p>The calling parameters to <strong class="command">rec:foo</strong> are the address and the length
of a word in RAM. The recognizer must not change it. The result
(i*x) is the parsed and converted data and the method table to
deal with it.</p>
<p>There is a standard method table that does not require
additional data (i*x is empty) and which is used to communicate
the &#8220;not-recognized&#8221; information: <strong class="command">r:fail</strong>. Its method
table entries throw the exception -13 if called.</p>
<p>Other pre-defined method tables are <strong class="command">r:intnum</strong> to deal with single
cell numeric data, <strong class="command">r:intdnum</strong> to work with double cell numerics and

more stack elements does not really provide a greater benefit (much more
code and only little speed enhancements).</p>
<p>The data stack starts at a configurable distance
below the return stack (RAMEND) and grows
downward.</p>

<h3>Return Stack<a class="headerlink" href="#return-stack" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Return Stack is the hardware stack of the
controller. It is managed with push/pop
assembler instructions. The default return stack
starts at RAMEND and grows downward.</p>

<div class="section" id="interrupts">
<h2>Interrupts<a class="headerlink" href="#interrupts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Amforth routes the low level interrupts into the
forth inner interpreter. The inner interpreter
switches the execution to a predefined word if an
interrupt occurs. When that word finishes execution,
the interrupted word is continued. The interrupt
handlers are completely normal forth colon words
without any stack effect. They do not get interrupted
themselves.</p>
<p>The processing of interrupts takes place in two steps:
The first one is the low level part.
It is called whenever an interrupt occurs. The code
is the same for all interrupts. It takes the number
of the interrupt from its vector address and stores
this in a RAM cell. Then the low level ISR sets the
<strong class="command">T</strong> flag in the status register of the controller
and returns with <strong class="command">RET</strong>.</p>
<p>The second step does the inner interpreter.
It checks the T-flag every time it is entered and,
if it is set, it switches to interrupt
handling at forth level. This approach has a penalty
of 1 CPU cycle for checking and skipping the branch
instruction to the isr forth code if no interrupt
occurred.</p>
<p>If an interrupt is detected, the forth VM clears the
T-flag and continues with the word <strong class="command">ISR-EXEC</strong>.
This word reads the currently active interrupt number and calls
the associated execution token.  When this word is finished,
the word <strong class="command">ISR-END</strong> is called. This word clears
the interrupt flag for the controller (<strong class="command">RETI</strong>).</p>
<p>This interrupt processing has two advantages: There are
no lost interrupts (the controller itself disables interrupts
within interrupts and re-transmits newly discovered interrupts
afterwards) and it is possible to use standard forth words
to deal with any kind of interrupts.</p>
<p>Interrupts from some hardware sources (e.g. the usart)
need to be cleared from the Interrupt Service Routine.
If this is not done within the ISR, the interrupt
is re-triggered immediately after the ISR returned control.</p>
<p>The downside is a relatively long latency since the the
forth VM has to be synchronized with the interrupt handling
code in order to use normal colon words as ISR. This penalty
is usually small since only words in assembly can cause the
delay.</p>

<h2>Word Lists and Environment Queries<a class="headerlink" href="#word-lists-and-environment-queries" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>

<div class="section" id="flash">
<h3>Flash<a class="headerlink" href="#flash" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The flash memory is divided into 4 sections. The
first section, starting at address 0, contains the
interrupt vector table for the low level interrupt
handling and a character string with the name of the
controller in plain text.</p>
<p>The 2nd section contains the low level interrupt
handling routines. The interrupt handler is very
closely tied to the inner interpreter. It is located
near the first section to use the faster relative
jump instructions.</p>
<p>The 3rd section is the first part of the dictionary.
Nearly all colon words are located here. New words
are appended to this section. This section is filled
with FFFF cells when flashing the controller
initially. The current write pointer is the DP
pointer.</p>
<p>The last section is identical to the boot loader
section of the ATmegas. It is also known as the NRWW
area. Here is the heart of amforth: The inner
interpreter and most of the words coded in assembly
language.</p>
<div class="section" id="flash-structure-overview">
<h4>FLASH Structure Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#flash-structure-overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<div class="figure" id="flashstructure">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/flash-structure.svg"><img src="../_images/flash-structure.svg" width="50%" /></a>
<p class="caption">Default Flash Structure</p>
</div>
<p>The reason for this split is a technical one: to
work with a dictionary in flash the controller needs
to write to the flash. The ATmega architecture
provides a mechanism called self-programming by
using a special instruction and a rather complex
algorithm. This instruction only works in the boot
loader/NRWW section. amforth uses this instruction
in the word I!. Due to the fact that the self
programming is a lot more then only a simple
instruction, amforth needs most of the forth core
system to achieve it. A side effect is that amforth
cannot co-exist with classic boot loaders. If a
particular boot loader provides an API to enable
applications to call the flash write operation,
amforth can be restructured to use it. Currently
only very few and seldom used boot loaders exist that
enable this feature.</p>
<p>Atmegas can have more than 64 KB Flash. This
requires more than a 16 bit address, which is more
than the cell size. For one type of those bigger
atmegas there will be an solution with 16 bit cell
size: Atmega128 Controllers. They can use the whole
address range with an interpretation trick: The flash
addresses are in fact not byte addresses but word
addresses. Since amforth does not deal with bytes
but cells it is possible to use the whole address
range with a 16 bit cell. The Atmegas with 128
KBytes Flash operate slightly slower since the
address interpretation needs more code to access the
flash (both read and write). The source code uses
assembly macros to hide the differences.</p>
<p>An alternative approach to place the elements in the flash shows picture
. Here all code goes into the RWW section. This layout definitely needs a
routine in the NRWW section that provides a cell level flash write functionality.
The usual boot loaders do not have such an runtime accessible API, only the
DFU boot loader from atmel found on some USB enabled controllers does.</p>

<div class="section" id="flash-write">
<h3>Flash Write<a class="headerlink" href="#flash-write" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The word performing the actual flash write
operation is <strong class="command">I!</strong>
(i-store). This word takes the value and the
address of a single cell to be written to flash
from the data stack. The address is a word
address, not a byte address!</p>
<p>The flash write strategy follows Atmel&#8217;s
appnotes. The first step is turning off all
interrupts. Then the affected flash page is read
into the flash page buffer. While doing the
copying a check is performed whether a flash
erase cycle is needed. The flash erase can be
avoided if no bit is turned from 0 to 1. Only if
a bit is switched from 0 to 1 must a flash page
erase operation be done. In the fourth step the
new flash data is written and the flash is set
back to normal operation and the interrupt flag
is restored. The whole process takes a few
milliseconds.</p>
<p>This write strategy ensures that the flash has
minimal flash erase cycles while extending the
dictionary. In addition it keeps the forth
system simple since it does not need to deal
with page sizes or RAM based buffers for
dictionary operations.</p>

<div class="section" id="eeprom">
<h2>EEPROM<a class="headerlink" href="#eeprom" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The built-in EEPROM contains vital dictionary
pointer and other persistent data. They need only a
few EEPROM cells. The remaining space is available
for user programs. The easiest way to use the EEPROM
is a <strong class="command">VALUE</strong>. There intended design
pattern (read often, write seldom) is like that for
the typical EEPROM usage. More information about
values can be found in the recipe <a class="reference internal" href="recipes/Values.html#values"><em>Values</em></a>.</p>
<p>Another use for EEPROM cells is to hold execution
tokens. The default system uses this for the turnkey
vector. This is an EEPROM variable that reads and
executes the XT at runtime. It is based on the
DEFER/IS standard. To define a deferred word in the
EEPROM use the Edefer definition word. The standard
word IS is used to put a new XT into it.</p>
<p>Low level space management is done through the the
EHERE variable. This is not a forth value but a EEPROM
based variable. To read the current value an
<strong class="command">&#64;e</strong> operation must be used, changes are written
back with <strong class="command">!e</strong>. It contains the highest EEPROM address
currently allocated. The name is based on the DP variable,
which points to the highest dictionary address.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ram">
<h2>RAM<a class="headerlink" href="#ram" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The RAM address space is divided into three
sections: the first 32 addresses are the CPU
registers. Above come the IO registers and extended
IO registers and finally the RAM itself.</p>
<p>amforth needs very little RAM space for its
internal data structures. The biggest part are the
buffers for the terminal IO. In general RAM is managed
with the words <strong class="command">VARIABLE</strong> and
<strong class="command">ALLOT</strong>.</p>
<p>Forth defines a few transient buffer regions for various purposes.
The most important is PAD, the scratch buffer. It is located 100 bytes
above the current HERE and goes to upper addresses. The Pictured Numeric
Output is just at PAD and grows downward. The word WORD uses the area above
HERE as it&#8217;s buffer to store the just recognized word from SOURCE.</p>
<div class="figure" id="ramfigure">

<p class="caption">Alternative RAM Structure</p>
</div>
<p>Another layout, that makes the external RAM easily available is shown in
<a class="reference internal" href="#ram2figure"><em>Alternative RAM Structure</em></a>. Here are the stacks at the beginning of the internal RAM and the
data space region. All other buffers grow directly into the external data space. From
an application point of view there is not difference but a speed penalty when
working with external RAM instead of internal.</p>
<p>With amforth all three sections can be accessed
using their RAM addresses. That makes it quite easy
to work with words like <strong class="command">C&#64;</strong>. The word <strong class="command">!</strong>
implements a LSB byte order: The lower part of the
cell is stored at the lower address.</p>
<p>For the RAM there is the word <strong class="command">Rdefer</strong>
which defines a deferred word, placed in RAM. As a
special case there is the word <strong class="command">Udefer</strong>
, which sets up a deferred word in the user area. To
put an XT into them the word <strong class="command">IS</strong>
is used. This word is smart enough to distinguish
between the various Xdefer definitions.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="does">
<h2>DOES&gt;<a class="headerlink" href="#does" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><strong class="command">DOES&gt;</strong> is used to change the runtime
action of a word that <strong class="command">create</strong>
has already defined.</p>
<p>Its working is described best using a
simple example: defining a constant. The standard
word <strong class="command">constant</strong> does exactly the
same.</p>
<div class="highlight-console"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="gp">&gt;</span> : con create , does&gt; @i ;
<span class="go"> ok</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;</span> 42 con answer
<span class="go"> ok</span>
<span class="gp">&gt;</span> answer .
<span class="go"> 42 ok</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The first command creates a new command <strong class="command">con</strong>. With
it a new word gets defined, in this example <strong class="command">answer</strong>.
<strong class="command">con</strong> calls <strong class="command">create</strong>, that parses the source
buffer and creates a wordlist entry <strong class="command">answer</strong>.  After that,
within <strong class="command">con</strong> the top-of-stack element (42) is compiled into
the newly defined word. The <strong class="command">does&gt;</strong> changes the
runtime of the newly defined word <strong class="command">answer</strong> to the code
that follows <strong class="command">does&gt;</strong>.</p>
<p><strong class="command">does&gt;</strong> is an immediate word. That means, it is not compiled
into the new word (con) but executed. This compile time action creates
a small data structure similar to the wordlist entry for a noname: word.
The address of this data structure is an execution token. This execution
token replaces the standard XT that <strong class="command">create</strong> has already
written for words that are defined using <strong class="command">con</strong>. This
leads inevitably to a flash erase cycle.</p>
