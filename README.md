amforth 5.8 ATmega328P Forthduino

I have a C:\amforth folder with versions 5.1, 5.3, 5.4, and now 5.8 in it, so I have been trying to do this for a while now. I finally noticed:

.equ F_CPU = 16000000 -> 8000000

and:

.set BAUD = 38400 

and thought I might try PuTTY at 19200 baud and pressed the reset button multiple times, until I got:

amforth 5.8 ATmega328P Forthduino

Not rocket science, and doesn't work or always take keyboard input, but encouraging. On the other hand:

Assembly failed, 39 errors, 44 warnings

And how to make:

Find the source files...

In the Project -> Properties -> Toolchain -> General, check Generate EEP file and

and finally!

------ Build started: Project: coinForth, Configuration: Debug AVR ------

I had to change the project name from my_amforth to coinForth because amforth.asm opened my_amforth.asm, which makes the build fail.

I also had to turn off the EESAVE and BOOTRST fuses and change the BOOSTSZ fuse from 1024W_3C00 to 2048W_3800. (E.g. HIGH = 0xD9).

I found that amForth can not handle direct file input, but the
